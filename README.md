# myip-pdns
PowerDNS pipe backend adapter powering myip.exposed heavily influenced by http://xip.io

I've run my own HTTP endpoint that returns my IP address for a while now and wanted
to make the process of getting my own IP even faster. Why bother with a HTTP
request with curl if I can simply do a DNS TXT record lookup and get my IP address.

I literally only need to do the DNS Lookup and can avoid that huge overhead
of a TCP connection followed by all that HTTP talk.

Okay, okay... While that may seem a legitimate reason to do this the _real_ reason
I decided to do this is to:

1. Get a _very_ simple intro to PowerDNS as a dynamic, authoritative name server.
I'm familiar with, and run a few NSD authoritative name servers but I've never really
played with PowerDNS.

2. Detect when an ISP or suspicious person is transparently routing all my interesting
DNS requests to their own DNS servers as I travel the world.

## TL; DR
Run `./bin/amijackt` and you'll have a good estimation of whether you're
talking to specific DNS servers directly (the request came via your default gateway)
or your request is going via a transparent third party DNS server which could
serve alternate IP addresses, log unnecessarily or help serve you phishing sites / scripts.

## Get my IP with DNS
```
$ dig myip.exposed @myip.exposed TXT

; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> myip.exposed @myip.exposed TXT
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 4641

Or for **just** your IP: 
```
$ dig myip.exposed @myip.exposed TXT +short
"202.7.172.86"
```

## Get my IP with HTTP(S)
```
$ curl -s https://myip.exposed
14.202.188.197
```

## Are my DNS requests being hijacked?

Well, when we queried the DNS server, the IP that the request came from was apparently `202.7.172.86` and
when we queried the HTTPS endpoint the _real_ IP the request came from was apparently `14.202.188.197`.

Something weird is going on:
* Our DNS traffic is possibly being transparently passed to a third party DNS server
* Our HTTP / HTTPS traffic is being proxied
* We're on a split tunneling or incorrectly configured VPN

### How can we check if our DNS is being hijacked? 
Simple, query a different DNS server:
```
$ dig myip.exposed @8.8.8.8 TXT

; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> myip.exposed @8.8.8.8 TXT
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 28484
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;myip.exposed.			IN	TXT

;; ANSWER SECTION:
myip.exposed.		300	IN	TXT	"202.7.165.68"

;; Query time: 461 msec
;; SERVER: 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8)
;; WHEN: Mon Mar 13 19:58:45 2017
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 55
```
If all our DNS traffic is being fed to an ISP / third party DNS server the values vill be the same.
These are infact the IP addresses of the recursive DNS servers our requests are being passed on to.

## Quickly see if ./amijackt
To make it easier for me to work out whether or not my DNS was being screwed with I wrote a check script:
```
./bin/amijackt
CRITICAL - DNS traffic is being hijacked. Use your VPN.
```
If everything looks good:
```
./bin/amijackt
OK - DNS and HTTP look OK. Better use your VPN just to be sure.
```
## PowerDNS configuration

Not going into too much detail... install powerdns and the pipe backend. These are in the EPEL repo on Centos. 
In your powerdns config:
```
...
cache-ttl=0
query-cache-ttl=0
launch=pipe
pipe-command=/opt/myip-pdns/bin/myip-pdns /opt/myip-pdns/etc/myip-pdns.conf
...
```
Caching **must** be off otherwise users will get served cached responses (someone else's IP). Bonus, you have your very own service like xip.io.

### What's My IP HTTP service
Simply use NGINX or **OpenResty**, ensure the ngx_http_realip_module is installed and add a location to return the IP. Example: 
```
        location / {
            return 200 "$realip_remote_addr\n";
        }
```

## That's all!
I really wish that ISP's, hotels and governments would stop screwing with our traffic.

DNS especially, is critical for application performance. If you screw with it you're
potentially making an already crappy experience even worse.
